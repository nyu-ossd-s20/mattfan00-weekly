title: Week 6 - Another Open Source Talk and Project Evaluations
---

As we start approaching spring break (in almost a week!!!) it's finally time to start thinking about which project we are going to contribute to for our final project. During this past week we had to do two project evaluations, which really helped me figure out what to look out for when trying to find a project to contribute too. In addition to this, we had another open source talk from Vicky Steeves. Let's get into that first. 

## Open Source Talk 

This talk was particularly focused on why she likes open source personally. This talk was interesting because she brought up a few points that I have not considered before.

The first point that she brought up was the importance of backing our code. Traditionally, many people just rely on posting their code on a centralized server like GitHub. However she broguht up the point that if GitHub all of a sudden goes down tomorrow or chooses to block off our code from us (after all they are a company) a majority of people's work will be gone. We depend too much on uploading our code to these servers and not backing them up on a separate system. 

Another point she brought up is reproducibility. Open source provides a great platform for people with all different computer environments to test out your code. If your code is working on your computer, that doesn't necessarily mean that it will work on everyone else's computer. Open source allows people to access your code, test it on their end, and then ultimately fix it so that it now works on that respective computer environment. 

One question I had for her was if she thinks that GitHub will ever be "overthrown" and be replaced in favor of some other code hosting platform. Ms. Steeves responded that she is not sure if this could happen, but she wishes that one day we will have decentralized hosting. In this scenario, everyone no longer goes to a certain server (GitHub) to store all of their code, but rather stores on their on server. It is weird to think about what a GitHub-less world would be, since GitHub has definitely had a huge presence when I started coding.
