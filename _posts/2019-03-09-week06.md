title: Week 6 - 
---


This week Vicky Steeves came into to talk to us again about Open Source. This talk was particularly focused on why she likes open source personally. This talk was interesting because she brought up a few points that I have not considered before.

The first point that she brought up was the importance of backing our code. Traditionally, many people just rely on posting their code on a centralized server like GitHub. However she broguht up the point that if GitHub all of a sudden goes down tomorrow or chooses to block off our code from us (after all they are a company) a majority of people's work will be gone. We depend too much on uploading our code to these servers and not backing them up on a separate system. 

Vicky Steeves Presentation
- Importance of backing up your code - if GitHub goes down tomorrow a lot of people's work is gone 
- Code preservation - need to find way of preserving coding environments so that we can always go back as we keep moving forward
- Idea of decentralizing hosting - everyone no longer goes to a certain server (GitHub) to store all of their code, but rather stores on their on server 
- Reproducibility - importance of open source in reproducibility and making sure the code works in all computer environments
