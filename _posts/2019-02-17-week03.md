title: Week 3 - Finalizing Firefox Browser Extension Project
---

If you have been keeping up with some of my previous blogs (check out my last blog [here](https://nyu-ossd-s20.github.io/mattfan00-weekly/week02/)) you would know that my group and I have been working on a Firefox browser extension. The bulk of the coding was finished last week, so this week was mostly focused on putting some finishing touches on the project.
