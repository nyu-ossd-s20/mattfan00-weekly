title: Week 3 - Finalizing Firefox Browser Extension Project
---

If you have been keeping up with some of my previous blogs (check out my last blog [here](https://nyu-ossd-s20.github.io/mattfan00-weekly/week02/)) you would know that my group and I have been working on a Firefox browser extension. The bulk of the coding was finished last week, so this week was mostly focused on finalizing the project and getting it ready to present. [Here](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s20/table_of_contents) is the link to the repository of the project. If you install it to the Firefox browser, you would be able to use it to navigate through this blog post!

## Some of the finishing touches 

In order to get the project ready to present, we mostly just ironed out some of the bugs. One of the issues we were having is that the extension was working on one persons local machine but not another persons. After some trial and error, we found that the reason for this was because one person deleted one line of code, while the other person left that line in. I think the overall lesson to be gained from this was that if when one solves a problem on their local machine, push the code to the repository so that everyone can start working off of it instead of some people having different versions of the project.
