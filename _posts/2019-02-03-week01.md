Nowadays, collaboration seems to be essential to success. Having the ability to be team-oriented and contribute your personal skills to benefit a project is important to many different jobs. Not one person knows or has the time to do everything so it is important for many people to come together to do the work that one person cannot. And to me this is what I think of when I hear the term "open source". My first experience with an open source project was working on a web browser game. I designed the frontend and the animations and posted my progress on Github. However at the time I didn't know how to do backend development for websites. So I sent the link to one of my friends and he pushed his backend code to Github and soon after we had a functioning video game that keeps track of user progress. I really enjoy the collaborative nature of open source, but I only experienced collaborating on projects with only a couple of people. Through taking the Open Source Software Development class at NYU, I look forward to contributing to larger projects and stepping out of my comfort zone.
